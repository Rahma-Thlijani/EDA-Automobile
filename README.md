# EDA-Automobile-Prediction
Data science project, in which we apply: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Feature Selection, and Deep learning model aiming to predict a car price.
## Data Description
We have two datasets in this project: "StatsVideosXALL.csv" (for the features) and "StatsVideosXALL.csv" (for the output).
The datasets has 3365 rows and 4 columns: Likes, Dislikes, Subscribers and Views, they are related to each youtube video. 
## Project Overview
In this data science project, we will focus on applying an **exploratory data analysis, visualizing the data, and selecting the features**. In addition, we will train a deep learning model aiming to predict the price of the car regarding its different properties. Finally, we will evaluate the model based on the MAE
the RMSE and the R2_Score.
## Project Steps
You will first understand the data the we will apply data exploration. Afterwards, we will train two different models and finally we will evaluate them.
All the project steps are organized and listed below:

1. Data Import
2. Data Understanding and Manipulation
3. Data Processing
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Feature Selection
6. Model Development
7. Model Evaluation

## Conclusion / Results
Two different learning algorithms (Multiple Linear Regression and Deep Neural Network) were tested, and we have evaluated their performance.
The best prediction performance was achieved with the Deep Neural Network model, and resulted in the following metrics:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 12317109.74
* Root mean squared error (RMSE): 56406118.44
* R-squared Score (R2_Score): 0.8038
